Hi Friends!!
This website is for our deparetment of ct-pg event "One Day Intra College Technical Symposium"
We developed this website just by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript 
I have used Anti-Privacy Code in this website, so the viewers can open the inspect section and it also can't copy or paste the content.

We didn't use backend to store the data.Instead, we connected the html form with google sheetes
